"""
    SeqSim(var₁=>param₁, var₂=>param₂, ...)

A sequential simulation solver.

## Parameters

* `estimator`    - Estimator used to construct conditional distribution
* `marginal`     - Marginal distribution used when neighbors are not available
                   (default to `Normal()`)
* `maxneighbors` - Maximum number of neighbors (default to 10)
* `neighborhood` - Search neighborhood (default to `nothing`)
* `distance`     - Distance used to find nearest neighbors (default to `Euclidean()`)
* `path`         - Simulation path (default to `RandomPath`)

For each location in the simulation `path`, a maximum number of
neighbors `maxneighbors` is used to fit a Gaussian distribution.
The nearest neighbors are searched according to a `distance`
or according to a `neighborhood` when the latter is provided.
